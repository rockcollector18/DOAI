# DOAI
Department of Artificial Intelligence is a LLM design for creating, refining, and further developing SOPs
Here’s how you would go about using the DOAI LLM across various platforms like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or Microsoft Copilot:
# 1. Prepare the DOAILLM.txt File
Ensure that the DOAILLM.txt file contains all the necessary instructions, guidelines, or knowledge you want the LLM to follow when generating responses. The text file might include detailed information, like:
Specific instructions for how to respond.
A particular domain of knowledge (e.g., cannabis SOPs in Florida).
Role-based information (e.g., guidelines for a medical marijuana business).
The file should be structured in a way that makes it clear to the AI model how it should process input and generate output based on this context.
# 2. Drop the DOAILLM.txt into the Chat Bar of the AI Model
For ChatGPT (OpenAI's Model)
ChatGPT (and other OpenAI models) generally doesn’t allow you to upload a file directly. However, you can:

# Copy-Paste: Open the DOAILLM.txt file on your local system and manually copy its contents. Then paste the text into the chat bar of ChatGPT.
Contextual Usage: You can prefix your message with a reference to the contents of the DOAILLM.txt. For example:
"Here is a set of instructions for our conversation: [paste contents of DOAILLM.txt]."
You could also preface each question with, “Using the information from the instructions in DOAILLM.txt, can you help me with…”
Steps:

# Open ChatGPT (or any platform using OpenAI's API).
Copy the entire content from DOAILLM.txt.
Paste the content into the chat input bar as context.
Ask the model your question, referencing the instructions or guidelines.
For Google Gemini (or Bard)
Google's Gemini (previously Bard) may not allow direct file uploads either, but it’s possible to achieve a similar result by copying and pasting the contents from DOAILLM.txt.

Copy-Paste: Open DOAILLM.txt, copy the text, and paste it into the Gemini chat.
Using Context: Provide the AI with relevant instructions from the text file before posing a question.
Steps:

# Open Google Gemini.
Copy the entire content from DOAILLM.txt.
Paste it into the chat as part of your initial message.
Ask your query with reference to the text file, such as “Based on the guidelines from the text file, can you help me with…”
For Microsoft Copilot
Microsoft Copilot may also have restrictions on file uploads, depending on the platform it is integrated with (such as in Microsoft Office apps). However, similar to the other models, you can copy and paste the content from DOAILLM.txt.

# Copy-Paste: Open DOAILLM.txt and copy its contents.
Use as Context: Paste the relevant content into Microsoft Copilot’s input chat, and then pose your query or request.
Steps:

# Open Microsoft Copilot (e.g., in Microsoft Word, Excel, or other integrated services).
Copy the contents of DOAILLM.txt.
Paste the content into the input chat or context box.
Ask your query or provide your command, using the guidelines from the DOAILLM.txt as context.
3. Alternative Approaches if Direct File Upload Is Supported
Some models (depending on the specific platform) may eventually allow direct uploads of .txt files for contextual processing. For example, as platforms like ChatGPT (and others) evolve, direct file upload options might be made available.

Direct File Upload: If a platform allows file uploads:
Locate the upload button or option within the AI interface.
Select the DOAILLM.txt file from your local system.
The AI model will process the contents of the file and respond based on its context.
Steps:

Open the AI platform.
Look for the file upload button or drag-and-drop area.
Upload DOAILLM.txt.
Wait for the model to process and provide responses based on the file content.
4. Interacting with the AI Model After Uploading/Pasting
Once the contents of DOAILLM.txt are provided to the model (either by pasting the text or uploading the file), you can interact with the model by asking it to generate responses, follow instructions, or assist with specific tasks. The model will use the context from the DOAILLM.txt file to guide its responses.

For example:

"Based on the instructions in the text file, what are the SOPs for cannabis cultivation in Florida?"
"According to the guidelines from DOAILLM.txt, can you generate an SOP for managing cannabis inventory?"
The AI will attempt to follow the logic, structure, and content provided in the DOAILLM.txt to respond accordingly.

Conclusion
To use the DOAI LLM (through DOAILLM.txt) in an AI model:

Prepare your DOAILLM.txt with all necessary guidelines and instructions.
Copy-paste the contents into the chat bar of an AI model (like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or Microsoft Copilot).
If the platform supports direct uploads in the future, you could simply upload the .txt file.
Interact with the AI, asking questions based on the context or guidelines provided in the DOAILLM.txt.
This approach ensures the AI model will generate responses that align with the specific instructions or context you provided in the text file.
